# BridgePad Desktop

The desktop receiver is a Rust workspace targeting Windows and Linux. Its
crates remain independent from Android UI and transport details.

The `bridgepad-protocol` crate validates the shared v1 wire vectors.
`bridgepad-transport-spike` compares encrypted transport candidates without
becoming a production transport. Additional crates for session state, virtual
devices, daemon and UI will be introduced behind explicit interfaces as their
Phase 0 spikes pass.

Run all current desktop checks with:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path desktop/Cargo.toml
```

Run the first encrypted transport measurement with:

```sh
cargo run --release --manifest-path desktop/Cargo.toml \
  -p bridgepad-transport-spike -- --iterations 2000 --payload-size 64
```

The spike compares TLS 1.3/TCP against a diagnostic plaintext TCP baseline on
loopback. It does not select the production transport by itself; QUIC and real
Android/Wi-Fi measurements are still required. Plaintext is never a product
mode.
